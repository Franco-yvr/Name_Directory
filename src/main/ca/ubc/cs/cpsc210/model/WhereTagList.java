Although it may//look redundant at this moment, this distinction will be necessary in the future because//I plan to add functionalities to ConnectTagList such as// - Notification to connect with the person at the specified time// - Creation of a calendar that can be synced with google calendar// - Addition of reason to reconnect and the discussion to be held// Therefore, for easing the development of these funtionalities in the future, keeping// ConnectTagList is beneficial
