//    1)  In composite pattern, you would remove all the redundant declarations and methods
////  2) You replace those duplicated declarations and methods by a generic method by a single declaration
//    and method "mother" and the type would be mother, basically you implement an abstract class
//    3) Go to your code and change your methods accordingly
//    4) In the pattern, the component is like an interface and the composite does 2 things: implement operations
//    and include a method called add component
//
//    The goal was to increase cohesion and eliminate duplication
//
