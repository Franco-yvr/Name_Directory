Tasks Done:
-Completed Jsonifier and Parser
-Made Name & Description as String and commented out tests
-Attempted to implement main
-implemented exceptions and tests for exceptions
-Set up the tests to be implemented
-Deleted addContact to reduce coupling
-replaced forloop for foreachloop in contactlist
-Implemented @override .equals & Hashmap for ContactList, Profile and TagList
-Implemented tests for Jsonifier and Parser
-Implemented tests for Equals & Hashmap override

Lessons learned:
-Learned about casting
-learned about JSON
-improved understanding Apparent/actual type: compiler only sees the apparent type, need to cast appearance(The actual type of the variable a is A. There's no changing that)https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1514214/java-terminology-clarification
-Realised that i will have to finish exception tasks before i can compile to run the test
-Random bits of learnings
-this was useful: https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/ui_controls/table-view.htm
